## Privacy Policy

MakeWP Test uses [MakeWP](https://makewp.dev) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

MakeWP SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users.

Integrating MakeWP SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**
